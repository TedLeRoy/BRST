				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><br/>
			  
				<h4>Can I trust this site?</h4>
				<p>Since the software is open source, and freely available, you can have a look for yourself. There are no features that surreptitiously store or send a copy of your file anywhere. Some security related features built into the BRST include:</p> 
				
				<ul>
					<li>Hosted BRST is via an HTTPS connection.</li>
					<li>A valid certificate has been purchased and applied.</li>
					<li>Processing is done on the client side using Javascript.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>That said, I don't own the server this is housed on, or any gear in between, so some precautions are in order. See "What precautions should I take?" below.</p>

				<h4>What is a border router?</h4>

				<p>A border router in the context of the BRST is a router that is positioned between a firewall and the Internet. They were often used as a conduit to connect a T1 or fractional T1 to a firewall which required an Ethernet connection.</p>
				<p>If you don't have a border router, and wonder what security measures you can take, or what the BRST can do for you, see "What if I don't have a border router?", or "If I don't have a border router how can I use the BRST?" below.</p>

				<h4>What precautions should I take?</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>Always have a backup of the running configuration (keep before and after changes copies).</li>
					<li>Do not use the user name or password you entered on the BRST form (change it before pasting it into the router).</li>
					<li>Consider using a fictitious outside IP Address and Gateway.</li>
					<li>If you're still concerned, or you want to modify the BRST, download the software, fire up a web server, and run it yourself.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>I used the tool and now my router's borked. What can I do?</h4>

				<p>Hopefully, you followed the steps on the <a href="index.html">Start Here</a> page and can get back up and running fairly quickly.</p>
						
				<ol>
					<li>Restore your router using the configuration file you created prior to using the BRST.</li>
					<li>Look over the session information you recorded when you tried to run the utility.</li>
					<li>Try correcting the error and reinstalling the configuration file.</li>
					<li>If for some crazy reason, you don't have a backup of the configuration, you should only need a few items to get back on line:</li>
					<li>Obtain the following information and enter it into the router:
						<ol>
							<li>The gateway for your router (should be provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP)).</li>
							<li>The interface, IP address, and subnet mask for your connection to your ISP (should also be provided by your ISP).</li>
							<li>The interface, IP address and subnet mask for your internal connection (you should know this or be able to find it out).</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>If the error is with the BRST itself, please contact me so I can correct the problem.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<h4>What if I don't have a border router?</h4>
				
				<p>If you don't have a border router, you can still make sure your border is secure. If you don't have a high priced corporate grade firewall from a company like Cisco or Juniper, and want an open source alternative, consider a firewall like <a href="https://pfsense.org/">PFSense</a>.</p>
				
				<p>If you have other Cisco routers or switches within your network, read "If I don't have a border router how can I use the BRST?" below.</p>
				
				<h4>If I don't have a border router how can I use the BRST?</h4>
				
				<p>With Ethernet hand off's from ISP's more and more common, border routers are less often used. If you don't have a border router, but still have Cisco routers and layer 3 switches, you can use the BRST to:</p>
				
				<ul>
				
					<li>Generate a secure configuration template you can then adapt to secure other Cisco devices.</li>
					<li>There are some things to be aware of if you do this:
						<ul>
							<li>The configuration file generated has built-in Access Control Lists (ACL's) which you'll have to locate and modify by hand to fit your network.</li>
							<li>You may have more interfaces or VLAN interfaces to handle than the tool was designed for. Try to replicate the intent of the ACL's for the various interfaces.</li>
							<li>There are additional measures you'll want to take on your Cisco switches, but many of the same configuration settings will apply to layer 3 switches.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				
				</ul>
