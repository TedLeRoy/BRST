		<h1>FAQ - Border Router Security Tool (BRST)</h1>

		<p class="catch-phrase">"Securing the Internet one router at a time."</p>

		<p>Answers to some frequently asked questions (or to questions you should perhaps ask yourself).</p>

				<dt>Can I trust this site?</dt>
				
				<dd>
					<p>Since the software is open source, and freely available, you can have a look for yourself. There are no features that surreptitiously store or send a copy of your file anywhere.</p>
					<p>That said, I don't own the server this is housed on, or any gear in between, so some precautions are in order. See "What precautions should I take?" below.</p>
				</dd>
				
				<dt>What precautions should I take?</dt>
				
				<dd>
					<p>While not directly security related, always have a backup of the running configuration (keep before and after changes copies).</p>
					<p>Do not use the username or password you entered on the BRST form (change it before pasting it into the router).</p>
					<p>Consider using a fictitious outside IP Address and Gateway.</p>
					<p>If you're truly paranoid, or you want to modify the BRST, download the software, fire up a web server with php enabled, and run it yourself.</p>
				</dd>
								
				<dt>I used the tool and now my router's borked. What can I do?</dt>
				
				<dd>
				<p>Hopefully, you followed the steps on the <a href="index.html">Start Here</a> page and can get back up and running fairly quickly.</p>
					
					<div class="sublist1">
					
						<ol>
							<li>Restore your router using the configuration file you created prior to using the BRST.</li>
							<li>Look over the session information you recorded when you tried to run the utility.</li>
							<li>Try correcting the error and reinstalling the configuration file.</li>
							<li>If for some crazy reason, you don't have a backup of the configuration, you should only need a few items to get back on line:</li>
							<li>Obtain the following information and enter it into the router:
								<ol>
									<li>The gateway for your router (should be provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP)).</li>
									<li>The interface, IP address, and subnet mask for your connection to your ISP (should also be provided by your ISP).</li>
									<li>The interface, IP address and subnet mask for your internal connection (you should know this or be able to find it out).</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>If the error is with the BRST itself, please contact me so I can correct the problem.</li>
